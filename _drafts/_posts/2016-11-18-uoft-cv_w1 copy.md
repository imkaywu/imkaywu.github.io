The topic of this week is a big part of Phycics-based Vision. We're concerned about the surface-light interaction w.r.t the material and geometric properties, illumination conditions.

## Basic Radiometric Terms

* **Flux (Power)**: Rate at which light is emitted from, or absorbed by, a (virtual) surface. Radiant power is specified in Watts (\\(1W = 1\frac{J}{S}\\)).
* **Irradiance**: Measure of light arriving at a surface (real or virtual, as a function of surface position; i.e., as power per unit surface area, (\\(\frac{W}{m^2}\\)). Irradiance spectral density is specified in units \\(\frac{W}{(nm)m^2}.\\). Irradiance is central to sensor (camera) measurements.
* **Radiance**: Measure of light as a function of direction and surface
area, i.e., power per unit surface area per steradian, \\(\frac{W}{m^2sr}\\) (or \\(\frac{W}{(nm)m^2sr}\\)). This allows us to describe the light emitted or reflected from a surface as a function of direction.
* **Steradian**: Measure of solid angle (angular extent in 3D). Solid angle (of patch S w.r.t. point \\(\vec{c}\\)) is measured in steradians (denoted \\(sr\\), defined as the ratio of projected area on a sphere to its squared radius, \\(\frac{a}{r^2}\\). One hemisphere is \\(2\pi\\) steradians.

## Irradiance

### Case 1: Distance point light source


### Case 2: Proximal point light source

### Case 3: Extended light source
