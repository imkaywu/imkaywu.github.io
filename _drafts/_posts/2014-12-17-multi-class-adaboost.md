## Introduction
This is the coding project of the course CPSC 540: Machine Learning. I implemented 2 kinds of multi-class adaboost algorithms: one-vs-rest multi-class classification using decision stumps as base learners and SAMME using decision trees as base learners. The source code is [here](https://github.com/imkaywu/CPSC540/tree/master/Coding%20project).
