Sorting is a task of rearranging arrays of items where each item contains a *key*. The objective is to rearrange the items such that their keys are in ascending or descending order.

> * Types of data. The sort code is effective for any type of data that implements Java's **Comparable** interface. This means that there is a method compareTo() for which v.compareTo(w) returns an integer that is negative, zero, or positive when v < w, v = w, or v > w, respectively.  
> * Reflexive: for all v, v = v;  
> * Antisymmetric: for all v and w, if (v < w) then (w > v); and if (v = w) then (w = v);  
> * Transitive: for all v, w, and x, if(v <= w) and (w <= x), then v <=x.  
> * v.compareTo(w) must throw an exception if v and w are of incompatible types or if either is null.

## Selection sort.

First, find the smallest item in the array, and exchange it with the first entry. Then, find the next smallest item and exchange it with the second entry. Continue in this way until the entire array is sorted.

> * In iteration i, find index min of smallest remaining entry.  
> * Swap a[i] and a[min]

**Cost**: election sort uses ~N2/2 compares and N exchanges to sort an array of length N.

**Code**

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class Selection_sort {
	public Selection_sort() {}
	
	// sort array in ascended order
	public void sort(Comparable [] a){
		int n = a.length;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
			int min = i;
			for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++){
				if(less(a[j], a[min])){
					min = j;
				}
			}
			exch(a, i, min);
		}
	}
	
	public void display(Comparable [] a){
		for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
			System.out.println(a[i] + " ");
		}
	}

	private boolean less(Comparable v, Comparable w){
		return v.compareTo(w) < 0;
	}
	
	private void exch(Object[] a, int i, int j){
		Object obj = a[i];
		a[i] = a[j];
		a[j] = obj;
	}
	
	// usefull for debugging
	private boolean isSorted(Comparable [] a){
		for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
			if(less(a[i + 1], a[i])){
				return false;
			}
		}
		return true;
	}
	
	public static void main(String [] args){
		Selection_sort selection = new Selection_sort();
		String [] a = {"E", "A", "S", "Y", "Q", "U", "E", "S", "T", "I", "O", "N"};
		selection.sort(a);
		selection.display(a);
	}
}

## Insertion sort.

Move the *ith* item one position at a time if it's larger than the left one. The algorithm ends when the left one is smaller or the item is at the begining of the array.

> * In iteration i, swap a[i] with each larger entry to its left.

**Cost**: For randomly ordered arrays of length N with with distinct keys, insertion sort uses ~N2/4 compares and ~N2/4 exchanges on the average. The worst case (inversed order) is ~ N2/2 compares and ~ N2/2 exchanges and the best case (sorted) is N-1 compares and 0 exchanges.

## Shellsort

Shellsort is a simple extension of insertion sort that gains speed by allowing exchanges of entries that are far apart, to produce partially sorted arrays that can be efficiently sorted, eventually by insertion sort. The idea is to rearrange the array to give it the property that taking every hth entry (starting anywhere) yields a sorted sequence. Such an array is said to be h-sorted.

By h-sorting for some large values of h, we can move entries in the array long distances and thus make it easier to h-sort for smaller values of h.
