3D reconstruction is the process of retrieving the 3D geometry and shape of the object or scene from either colour/depth image, or point clouds obtained from active sensing techniques. This post will give a thorough and detailed review of almost all categories of 3D reconstruction algorithms to date.

3D reconstruction deals with the inverse process of image formation, as most of the computer vision problems do, which makes it super hard to solve. As mentioned in one seminar paper, the potential reconstruction to the same input images is countless.
