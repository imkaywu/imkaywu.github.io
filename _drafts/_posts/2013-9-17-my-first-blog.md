Hello, everyone! This is the first page of my blog and from today on, I'm gonna share my thoughts and coding experience in this blog, hopefully, these blogs will help the folks who neet it. The primary motivation for me to setup this blog is to record my journey as the learner of programming and help myself to be more professional in the coming days. Besides, I'm also gonna share things like my favorite musics and movies and talk about my feeling towards these stuffs cause that's something I love. So this is a day to remember, and I hope I can have fun writing this blog.
