This is a side project I did during my second term.

## Projection to Cylindrical plane

The solution to this problem is to project the pictures onto the surface of a cylinder, then unroll the cylinder to make a flat plane. This yields a single image you can display on a screen, or print on a piece of paper. To see how this works, click on the Project button in the applet above. You'll see red lines of sight extend from the center of projection (red ball) through each picture and continue into they strike the surface of a cylinder (gray mesh). This produces a distorted version of the picture, which appears affixed to the mesh, as well as at the right side of the applet (briefly).

Once all pictures have been projected in this way (hit Skip Animation if you're impatient), click on Blend to feather the pictures one into the other. This removes the obvious seams between pictures. If you now slit the mesh and unroll it, you produce an image (shown at the bottom) you could print. It contains distortions; in particular, straight lines in the scene are no longer straight in the panorama. But like a map projection of the Earth, it's the best we can do. And if your panorama is of a mountainscape instead of an architectural scene like Stanford's old quad, you may never notice the distortions.
