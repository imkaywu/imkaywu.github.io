This is my improved implementation of Example-based Photometric Stereo using coarse-to-fine normal sampling. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/imkaywu/Coarse2Fine-Example-based-Photometric-Stereo).

## Input data and Results

### bottle

{% include gallery caption="Input data of bottle" %}

### bottle

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="Input data of cup" %}

### cat

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Input data of cat" %}

## Procedure

Our implementation is inspired by the work "A Dictionary-based Approach for Estimating Shape and Spatially-Varying Reflectance". The cost function is

\\[\hat{n} = arg min_{\tilde{n}\in N}min_{a_1, a_2 > 0}\|I_t - a_1 I_d(\tilde{n}) - a_2 I_s(\tilde{n})\|\\]

The observation is that there is a gradual increase in error value as the normal is moving away from the global minimal of \\(E(\dot)\\). We exploit this to design a coarse-to-fine search strategy where we first evaluate the candidate normals at a coarse sampling and subsequently search in the vicinity of this solution but at a finer sampling.

Specifically, let \\(N_\theta\\) be the set of equi-angular sampling on the unit-sphere where the angular spacing is \\(Î¸\\) degrees. Given a candidate normal \\(n\\) , we define

\\[C_\theta(\hat{n}) = \{ n \mid \langle n, \tilde{n} \rangle \geq \cos\theta, \|n\|_2 = 1 \} \\]

as the set of unit-norm vector within \\(\theta-\\)degree from \\(\tilde{n}\\).

In the first iteration, we initialize the candidate normal set \\(\mathcal{N}^{(1)} = \mathcal{N}_theta_1\\). Now, in the \\(j\\)th iteration, we solve over a candidate set \\(\mathcal{N}^(j)\\). Suppose that \\(\hat{n}^{(j)}\\) is the candidate normal where minimum occurs at the \\(j-\\)th iteration. The candidate set for the \\((j + 1)-\\)th iteration is constructed as

\\[j \geq, \mathcal{N}^{(j+1)}=C_{\theta_j}(\hat{n}^{(j)}) \cap \mathcal{N}_{\theta_{j+1}} \\]

with \\(\theta_{j+1} \lt \theta_j\\). That is, the candidate set is simply the set of all candidates at a finer angular sampling that are no greater than the current angular sampling from the current estimate. This is repeated till we reach the finest resolu- tion at which we have candidate normals. For the results in this paper, we use the following values: \\(\theta_1=10^\circ, \theta_2=5^\circ, \theta_3=3^\circ, \theta_4=1^\circ, \theta_5=0.5^\circ\\).
