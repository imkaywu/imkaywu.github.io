## Goal

In traditional Chinese lectures, there is a long-lasting problem, that is the lack of interaction between lecturers and students. To address this issue, we intend to develop a system that can let students participate in, yet not so obstrusively, the lecture. In the meantime, lecturers can keep track of the performance of each student.

## Scenario 1:

The lecturer has some multiple choice questions and display them using PPT. The student can send their answers using this app. Moreover, any change during a single session is valid, that means, if you want to change your answer, just select another one and send it, this new answer will automatically overwrite the previous one. After the lecturer close the histogram graph, the answers for this question will automatically saved in a text format as a record.

## Scenario 2

Students may have many questions to ask, but due to the limited time during the lectures and the unwillingness of students to ask questions in public, we designed a text-message like function for the app. The student can type in whatever questions they have and send to the PC. The PC program will automatically store the questions and for the review of the lecturers after lectures.
