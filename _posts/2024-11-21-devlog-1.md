## Progress
I've finished three systems in the past 2 weeks: a game time/day&night system, a farming system and a save system.

The game time system went much more smoothly than I initially thought. The basic
idea is that for every real world second, the game time goes by $$N$$ seconds,
where $$N$$ is currently set to 64. So for a working day of 20 hours in the game (from 6am - 2am), it would take $$20 \times 60/64 = 18.75 min$$ to complete.

Once we have the game time system, I implemented two different methods to achieve the day&night system: first method is to use a directional light, the second method is to use a CanvasModulate and a gradient texture. The second approach gives me more control, thus I decided to keep the second one.

Once I have the game time, I can go ahead and grow some crops. This part is more
tricky since it needs the previously implemented components (player, collectable scenes, inventory/hotbar), new animations (tilling soil and watering crops), new tilemap layers (tilled soil) and a growth cycle component and new harvestable scenes to show the growth of crops. I managed to put everything together for this first version. But I expect to make some improvements to the current system later and add more crops.

The last system I implemented is a save system, which can save the state of the
game on file and re-load the game. It's not super important for the gameplay at
the moment, but I want to have all the necessary components there and ready so
that when I add new systems, they can be integrated to the save system fairly
easily.

## TODO
I'm not ready to show any pictures or videos of the game since I'm using other
people's assets. I'm still working on my pixel art skills, even though it's a slow and
tedious process. But I'm working on it, and it will be done. I hope by the end
of this year, I can create a map using all my assets (at least for the
environment) so that I can have some videos ready to show. Here is one of my
recent drawings (pixel-art really looks best when zoomed out, smh).
