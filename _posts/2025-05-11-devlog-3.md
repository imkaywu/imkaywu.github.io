I have taken a short break from game dev since last December. But I'm finally back at it since mid March, about a month and a half ago.

During this time, I mainly focused on fixing some existing issues in the game: fixed some UI issues in hotbar and inventory system, fixed the resolution
and auto scaling issue of UI elements, added FarmingManager to handle watering more correctly, updated the re-usable interactable component, redid the pickup/collectible component, developed state machine for player and enemy movement replacing AnimationTree node, created enemy scenes (slime and goblin), created scene
transition, level manager and so on. I also went through several iterations of refactoring to make the codebase more consistent and readable.

Next I will go back to building more important game mechanics and systems for my game.
