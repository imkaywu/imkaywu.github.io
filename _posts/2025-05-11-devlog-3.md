I have taken a short break from game dev since last December. But I'm finally back at it since a month and a half or so ago.

For the past few weeks, I focused mainly on fixing some of the existing issues in
the game: fixed some UI issues in hotbar and inventory system, fixed the resolution
and auto scaling of UI elements, added FarmingManager to handle watering more
correctly, updated interactable component, redid the pickup/collectible component, developed state machine for player
and enemy movement, created enemy scenes (slime and goblin), created scene
transition, level manager and so on. I also went through several iterations of refactoring to make everything is more consistent and
readable.
