Since there are a very good open sources software for feature detection and description, for instance, 
vlfeat, I simply created a wrapper class for easy access of these functionalities instead of implementing from scratch. However, I do intend to implement simple version of those feature detection techniques just for practice purposes, and that's for another day.
