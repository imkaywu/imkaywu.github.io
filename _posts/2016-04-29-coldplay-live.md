Coldplay is my favourite band. Here is a list of my favourite Coldplay songs and their awesome live performances.

## Fix you
Fix you is definitely my favourite Coldplay song, and one of my all-time favourites. I can listen to it repeatedly literally for weeks.

## The scientist
There is no way you can know that this is a love song before you read the lyrics. As always, beautiful melody and lyrics, one of the best melancholy songs.

## Yellow
Yellow is the first Coldplay song that I've ever listened and fell instant love with it. At that time, I thought: How could they come up with another song to beat that? I'm so glad that I was completely wrong.
