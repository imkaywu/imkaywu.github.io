Ed Sheeran is an amazing song writer and live performer. Those beautiful melody and lyrics of his can always make me feel peaceful and relaxed.

## Thinking out loud
This song is probably in everybody's top list. Its melody sounds so simple, yet the lyrics so well written and touching. Ed performed this song in The Voice 2014.

Here is another performance from Jumpers for GoalPosts Live at Wembley.

## Photograph
Ed always gives his best live performance when playing this song. I especially like his falseto. This performance is from Rock in Rio 2015.

Another great live performance is from his Wembley concert. This video is flipped, Ed is actually right-handed.

## The A Team
This is Ed's debut single and has almost everything that we love from an Ed Sheeran song - upbeat melody, great lyrics. It's a song about a prostitute who is addicted to crack cocaine - a "class A drug". Ed brilliantly covered this dark and heavy subject matter using upbeat tunes.

## Lego house
This is my first Ed Sheeran song. I fell instant love with it, especially this one: `And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm. If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now`. I've never heard anyone sing like that in this kind of songs.

## Small bump

This is another sad song that is beautifully written. It's about a miscarriage at five month of pregnancy, and is written from the mom's perspective.
