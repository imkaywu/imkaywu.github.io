This is the course project of CPSC 554M, which is done with the collaboration with Matthew Fong and Xueqin Zhang.

## Goal

As more and more videos are being consumed over the web, organizing and searching for videos becomes more difficult. Videos in at-a-glance search spaces are generally represented by a title, a description, and static thumbnail to show the contents of the video. In the particular case where a user is looking for a video they have seen before, this information may not be enough to trigger a user's memory of the video. We introduce two techniques to represent video in a personalized way that is unique to the user through the analysis of their viewing behaviour, as well as explicit bookmarking for representative thumbnail selection. We performed a formal evaluation on the techniques compared with the traditional YouTube style representation and found users were faster in selecting the video using our methods, and also preferred our method.

### player

The video playing/viewing interface

### filmstrip

A filmstrip consists one or several static/dynamic thumbnails, used to quickly skim through the whole video and jump to the segment of interest.

### thumbnail

A thumbnail is static or dynamic images extracted from videos to represent and summarize the videos.
