<p>The Strat was so well designed that the world had to wait for 10 years to appreciate its greatness.</p>

<h2 id="the-birth-in-1954">The Birth in 1954</h2>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>

<p>The design of Stratocaster (Strat for short) was heavily influenced by its two predecesors – Telecaster (Tele for short) and the two-horned shape Precision Bass.</p>

<p>In early 1953, the body of the Strat still closely resembled that of a Tele. Musician <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Freddy+Tavares&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Freddy Tavares</a> came up with a design that combined features from Fender’s two first instruments.</p>

<p>Tele wasn’t known for its comfortability since the squared-off body digs into
the player’s body. Guitarist <a href="">Rex Gallion </a> was often credited with suggesting a rounded edges and contoured body.</p>

<p><strong>Pickup</strong></p>

<p>Single-coil alnico 3 pickups. Electronics were mounted to the single-ply white plastic pickguard (anodized aluminum on some early models) rather than to the body, enabling an entire pickguard/pickups/controls assembly to be dropped in place and screwed on (using eight screws) and only requiring connection to the output jack. The three control knobs placed near the bridge were within easy reach of the strumming/picking hand—a master volume and two tone controls for the neck and middle pickups.</p>

<p><strong>Color</strong></p>

<p>To give the guitar a more high end look, Fender sales chief <a href="">Don Randall</a> insisted on a sunburst finish: a brownish-black outer hue called dark Salem, which graduated to a golden inner hue called canary yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong></p>

<p>Leo Fender designed a brand new vibrado system. The initial design is not a success, used a bridge with rollers for each string and a separate tailpiece. In this design, the strings actually moved over the bridge on the rollers.</p>

<p>The new design the whole bridge assembly moved with the strings rather than
having the strings move over rollers with the bridge remaining stationary.</p>

<p>There are three major parts: a tremolo bar, a bridge plate, and an adjustable anchor plate. The tremolo bar is inserted into the bridge. The rear of the bridge plate is unanchored and bent slightly upward; the front was fixed to the guitar body with six screws, one in front of each bridge saddle. The entire bridge could be rocked back and forth using an easily detachable “tremolo” arm, thus raising and lowering pitch. The anchor plate is placed inside the back compartment and screwed to the forward wall of the cavity. The bridge is attached to the anchor plate by three springs.</p>

<p><strong>Misc</strong>
A slanting output jack mounted on the face of the guitar rather than the side.</p>

<p>This post is published so that it would push me to actually finish it. It’ll be about the history of this beautiful instrument, its evolution and changes over the years and decades, and all the guitar heros, old and new, that ever make them gently weep.</p>

<h2 id="strat-of-mine---jane">Strat of Mine - Jane</h2>
<p>I don’t name my guitars unless I’m certain that I will keep them for the rest of my life just in case I wouldn’t get attached to them. My very first Strat is a Mexico-made Fender Player version Strat. To honor my favorite female author - Jane Austin, I decided to name her Jane.</p>
