<h2 id="before-stratocaster">Before Stratocaster</h2>

<p>The design of Stratocaster (Strat for short) was heavily influenced by its two predecesors – Telecaster (Tele for short) and the two-horned shape Precision Bass. Musician <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Freddy+Tavares&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Freddy Tavares</a> came up with a design that combined features from Fender’s two first instruments.</p>

<p>In early 1953, the body of the Strat still closely resembled that of a Tele. Tele wasn’t known for its comfortability since the squared-off body digs into the player’s body. Guitarist <a href="">Rex Gallion </a> was often credited with suggesting a rounded edges and contoured body.</p>

<p>The Strat was so well designed that the world had to wait for 10 years to appreciate its greatness.</p>

<h2 id="the-birth-on-october-1954">The Birth on October 1954</h2>

<p>The Strat body featured a two-horned cutaway, rounded edges and contoured body. It was made of ash, which is known to have a nice twang and a good sustain.</p>

<p>To give the guitar a more high end look, Fender sales chief <a href="">Don Randall</a> insisted on a sunburst finish: a brownish-black outer hue called dark Salem, which graduated to a golden inner hue called canary yellow.</p>

<p>The U-shaped neck was made of a single piece of maple with black dot position markers. The walnut “skunk strip” ran down on the back of the neck where truss rod was installed. The fingerboard had a 7.25” fingerboard radius with small (.078” wide) frets.</p>

<p>Stratocaster introduced the single-coil alnico triple-pickup configuration. Electronics were mounted to the single-ply white plastic pickguard (anodized aluminum on some early models) rather than to the body, enabling an entire pickguard/pickups/controls assembly to be dropped in place and screwed on (using eight screws) and only requiring connection to the output jack. The three control knobs placed near the bridge were within easy reach of the strumming/picking hand—a master volume and two tone controls for the neck and middle pickups.</p>

<p>The bridge is Strat’s biggest innovation. Leo Fender designed a brand new vibrado system. The initial design is not a success, used a bridge with rollers for each string and a separate tailpiece. In this design, the strings actually moved over the bridge on the rollers. a steel two-piece unit with six saddles that could be adjusted for intonation and height.</p>

<p>The new design the whole bridge assembly moved with the strings rather than having the strings move over rollers with the bridge remaining stationary.</p>

<p>There are three major parts: a tremolo bar, a bridge plate, and an adjustable anchor plate. The tremolo bar is inserted into the bridge. The rear of the bridge plate is unanchored and bent slightly upward; the front was fixed to the guitar body with six screws, one in front of each bridge saddle. The entire bridge could be rocked back and forth using an easily detachable “tremolo” arm, thus raising and lowering pitch. The anchor plate is placed inside the back compartment and screwed to the forward wall of the cavity. The bridge is attached to the anchor plate by three to five springs.</p>

<p>Some other interesting notes about the original production Strat: a slanting output jack mounted on the face of the guitar rather than the side. Serial numbers, originally located on the back tremolo plate, were moved to the neck plate in early summer 1954. Fender was using polystyrene based plastics for their guitars, which is commonly nicknamed bakelite (pronounced Bake-A-Lite). It was very brittle, and would wear down and crumble apart quite easily (not sure if it’s 1954).</p>

  <li>Body: Ash</li>
  <li>Finish: Two-color sunburst</li>

  <li>Pickup: 3 single coil, 3-way switch</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="year-of-1955">Year of 1955</h2>
<p>There were not significant changes happening to Strat besides slightly refinements. The production process was improved, leading to a lighter weight. Serial number, located in the back metal neck plate, generally ranges from 6000 to 9000,</p>

<p>The brittle plastic originally used for Stratocaster pickguards, control knobs and pickup covers was replaced with a more durable plastic in 1955.</p>

<p>The round string holes in the rear tremolo plate became oval-shaped in mid 1955.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="year-of-1956">Year of 1956</h2>

<p>1956 Fender Stratocaster serial numbers generally run from 9000 to 16000 (stamped on the neck plate).</p>

<p>Fender switched from ash to less-expensive and more easily workable alder for sunburst Stratocaster bodies in mid 1956 (blond Strats still use Ash). The finish process also changed: the yellow/amber tint for the sunburst finish started to be dyed into the wood, as opposed to being sprayed, making the process more efficient and economical. Then an outer edge was sprayed to create the burst.</p>

<p>The headstock’s round string retainer was switched to the “butterfly” string tree with a “half-tunnel” guide for the B and high E strings.</p>

<p>In mid 1956, the tuners were switched from the Kluson “no-line” tuners to the Kluson Deluxe “single-line” tuners (which feature “Kluson Deluxe” engraved in them in a vertical line).</p>

  <li>Pickup: 3 single coil, 3-way switch</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="year-of-1957">Year of 1957</h2>

<p>The 1957 Fender Stratocaster is considered a “classic” year by most with its two-tone sunburst finish on an Alder body wood with a Maple “V” neck. Serial number range for the 57 Fender Stratocaster are generally 16000 to 25000 (some numbers with a “0” or “-“ prefix on the neck plate).</p>

<p>Most 1957 Strats have a neck with a strong “V” backshape.</p>

<p>The plastics for a Stratocaster includes the volume and tone knobs, the pickup selector tip, the pickup covers, and the pickguard. Fender started using ABS plastic instead of polystyrene, which is more resistant and does not crumble like a cracker in mid 1957.</p>

<p>George Fullerton created what is now referred to as the first “official” Fender custom color—the Fiesta Red—circa 1957.</p>

<h2 id="year-of-1958">Year of 1958</h2>

<p>The 1958 Fender Stratocaster saw some major changes take place. The serial number range for the 58 Fender Stratocaster’s are generally from 25000 to 30000 (some numbers start with a “0” or “-” prefix on the neck plate).</p>

<p>The ‘V’-shaped profile was changed back to ‘D’-shaped neck (thin ‘U’-shaped neck).</p>

<p>The two-color sunburst finish became a three-color sunburst finish in the first half of 1958 with the addition of an “in between” red hue.</p>

<h2 id="year-of-1959">Year of 1959</h2>

<p>The one-piece neck-fingerboard was replaced by a two-piece construction consisting of a rosewood “slab” fingerboard (so nicknamed later on for its thickness and flat bottom) glued atop the maple neck.</p>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col half" src="/assets/img/music/stratocaster/neck_maple.jpg" alt="" title="maple neck" />

</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

<p>The ‘skunk stripes’ were rendered unnecessary because the truss rods channels on those instruments were routed into the front of the neck rather than the back, and then covered by the glued-on fingerboards.</p>

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col half" src="/assets/img/music/stratocaster/neck_maple_trussrod.jpg" alt="" title="maple neck trussrod" />

</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Left: one-piece maple with "skunk strip" on the back; Right: maple neck with rosewood

</div>

<p>These new rosewood-fingerboard models also replaced the black marker dots on the side of the neck with new off-white “clay” dots.</p>

<p>The red dye in the finish was very reactive to UV light, causing it to fade, so your 3-color sunburst guitar suddenly became a 2-color sunburst</p>

<p>The single-ply white pickguard was replaced by multi-ply white-black-white celluloid pickguard with more screw holes (11) and a notable greenish tint.</p>
